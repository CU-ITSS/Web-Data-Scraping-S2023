In the case of the Oscars, the URLs appear to be consistently formatted: `https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2019` suggests that we could change the 2019 to any other date going back to the start of the Oscars and get that year as well: `https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2018` should get us the page for 2018, and so on. Let's demonstrate each of these strategies with the Oscars data: iterating from 2019 back to 1929 in the URL versus parsing the list of links from the header.\n",
